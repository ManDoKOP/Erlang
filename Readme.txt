1. Calculation of Pi
Given that Pi can be estimated using the function 
4 * (1 – 1/3 + 1/5 – 1/7 + …) 
with more terms giving greater accuracy, 
write a erlang program that calculates Pi to an accuracy of 5 decimal places.

2. Count unique items
Given a list such as 
[2,5,3,6,3,2,7,8,5,6]
Show only the unique items in the list
Count how many unique items there are

3.Make it concurrent
Take ccharcount.erl and make it concurrent.
Lets time my solution and the previous 2.
